# Education

*Queen's University*, Ph.D. Evolutionary Ecology and Quantitative Genetics \hfill 2023

*Queen's University*, MSc. Evolutionary and Ecological Genetics \hfill 2018

*Queen's University*, B.Sc. (Hons) Biology \hfill 2016

# Teaching 

## Teaching Fellowship

I taught a ~300 student undergraduate course on evolutionary genetics. The course is a required biology course at Queen's University and introduces population genetics, quantitative genetics, and evolutionary genomics.

## Teaching Assistanceships

I've helped to teach five biology courses at Queen's University, topics included introductory genetics, evolutionary genetics, conservation biology, and evolutionary biology. I designed and taught a custom tutorial on quantitative genetics and conservation for an upper-year genetics course. 

## Student Supervision

I've helped co-supervise three honours thesis students at Queen's University on effective population size, phenotypic plasticity, and measuring selection in captivity. At African Lion Safari I help supervise and guide staff-led research projects (~8 staff) that include work on artificial reproduction, nutrition, population genetics, and quantiative genetics of ex situ populations. I'm currently supervising a research assistant who is developing a PhD proposal for collaboration with a Canadian University. 

*Hana Thompson* Genomics, plasticity, and selection in ex situ and in situ conservation programs 2023-Present. Hana is funded by African Lion Safari and is working to develop a PhD in collaboration with an academic partner. 

*Dominique Charland* Measuring unintentional selection in a captive breeding program for the Eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans) 2022. Dominique is now a JD candidate at the University of Ottawa.

# Research Skills

## Statistics and Bioinformatics
I have used R throughout my academic career and I am comfortable with generalized linear models, mixed models, and non-linear models. I am familiar with the population modelling software Vortex and running individual based demographic models. I am proficient in basic bioinformatics (filtering and preparing ddRADseq or whole genome data) and I am comfortable navigating and submitting jobs on a UNIX computer cluster. I have done basic programming in Python and have run non-linear and custom Bayesian models using STAN. I am happy and eager to learn and work with the best statistical software for any given analysis. 

## Fieldwork
Currently, I am leading a team in the collection of reproductive data on an ex situ breeding program of Northern Bobwhite with a planned future reintroduction in collaboration with the Nature Conservancy of Canada in Southern Ontario. I have spent three field seasons working with numerous seabird species in Northern Alaska, Newfoundland, and the Gulf of Alaska. I have worked with both small and large teams under difficult weather conditions to collect blood samples, make field observations, and capture and record morphometrics. I led the field team on Middleton Island for part of the 2019 field season. I have worked with teams in France to help maintain long-term data sets on great and blue tits near Montpellier and Corsica.

## Labwork
I am proficient in DNA extraction, PCR, microsatellite analysis, and preparing DNA samples for next-generation sequencing. I am currently learning to extract, preserve, culture, and donate primordial germ cells from avian embryos.
