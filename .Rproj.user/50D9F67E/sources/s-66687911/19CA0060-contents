# Education

*Queen's University*, Ph.D. Evolutionary Ecology and Quantitative Genetics \hfill Exp. Compl. 04/2023

*Queen's University*, MSc. Evolutionary and Ecological Genetics \hfill 2018

*Queen's University*, B.Sc. (Hons) Biology \hfill 2016


# Research Experience

## Statistics and Bioinformatics
I have used R throughout my academic career and I am comfortable with generalized linear models, mixed models, and non-linear models. I am proficient in basic bioinformatics (filtering and preparing ddRADseq or whole genome data) and comfortable navigating and submitting jobs on a UNIX computer cluster. I have done basic programming in Python and have run non-linear and custom Bayesian models using STAN. I am happy and eager to learn and work with the best statistical software for any given analysis. 

## Fieldwork
I have spent three field seasons of working with numerous seabird species in Northern Alaska, Newfoundland, and in the Gulf of Alaska. I have worked with both small and large teams under difficult weather conditions to collect blood samples, make field observations, and capture and record morphometrics. I was in charge of the field team on Middleton Island for part of the 2019 field season. I have worked with teams in France to help maintain long-term data sets on great and blue tits near Montpellier and in Corsica.

## Labwork
I am proficient in DNA extraction, PCR, microsatellite analysis, and preparing DNA samples for next-generation sequencing.

# Teaching Assistantships

I've helped to teach five biology courses at Queen's University. Topics included introductory genetics, evolutionary genetics, conservation biology, and evolutionary biology. I designed and taught a custom tutorial on quantitative genetics and conservation for an upper-year genetics course. I've helped co-supervise three honours thesis students at Queen's University on effective population size, phenotypic plasticity, and measuring selection in captivity.
