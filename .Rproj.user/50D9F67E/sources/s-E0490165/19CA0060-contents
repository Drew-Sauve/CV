# Education

*Queen's University*, MSc. Evolutionary and Ecological Genetics \hfill 2018

*Queen's University*, B.Sc. Biology \hfill 2016


# Research Experience

## Fieldwork
Three field seasons of working with numerous seabird species in Northern Alaska, Newfoundland, and in the Gulf of Alaska. Worked with both small and large teams under difficult weather conditions to collect blood samples, make field observations, and capture and record morphometrics. Directed a small team for targetted seabird sampling and specific data collection. Helped teach and guide undergraduates in the collection of seabird blood samples. 

## Labwork
Proficient in DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, microsatellite analysis, and preparing DNA samples for next-generation sequencing.

## Statistics and Bioinformatics
Proficient in basic bioinformatics and comfortable with navigating and submitting jobs on a UNIX computer cluster. Proficient in programming in both Python and R. Comfortable with generalized linear models, mixed models, and non-linear models in both frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. Skilled in quantitative genetic analyses.
