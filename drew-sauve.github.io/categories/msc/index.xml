      <description>Population adjustment of phenology is an important aspect of adapting to climate change. Changes in phenology can occur through either phenotypic plasticity or microevolution. Few studies have investigated the relative importance of these processes in Arctic environments, where atmospheric temperatures are rising at a greater rate than the global mean, shifting the region’s seasonality, and affecting ecosystems. Using detailed individual and pedigree data and we evaluated the contribution of plasticity and microevolution to known changes in breeding phenology over a 42-year period in a High Arctic seabird, Mandt’s black guillemot (Cepphus grylle mandtii).</description>
